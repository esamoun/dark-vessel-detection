# Failure log

What was tried and did not work, and what it cost. Kept deliberately: the dead ends are part of
the method, and a pipeline whose limits are known is more useful than one whose limits are not.

Each entry: what was attempted, what happened, why, and what was done instead.

## 2026-08-13 — `.gitignore` silently deleted a source package

**What happened.** `.gitignore` opened with an unanchored `data/`, meant for downloaded imagery
at the repository root. A gitignore pattern containing no slash matches at *every* level, so it
also matched `src/darkvessel/data/` — the package holding scene loading, AIS ingestion, tiling
and the synthetic inputs. Six source files were never tracked. Nothing complained: the working
copy was complete, the tests passed, and the scaffold commit that introduced the rule looked
clean.

**What it would have cost.** A clone of this repository could not have imported `darkvessel.cli`
at all. Confirmed by checking the staged tree out into an empty directory and running the suite
there — `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'darkvessel.data'`.

**Why it survived.** Every check ran against the working directory, which had the files. No
check ran against what was actually committed.

**What was done instead.** The rules are anchored to the repository root — `/data/`, `/outputs/`,
`/checkpoints/` — so they cannot reach into `src/`. The lesson generalises past this bug: a test
suite that only ever runs in the working directory cannot see what the repository is missing.

## 2026-08-13 — The chain read the holes in a product as the brightest ships in it

**What happened.** The first real Sentinel-1 scene run end to end returned 126 detections. Twelve
were not vessels. Earth Engine writes masked pixels as a fill value and declares that value as
nodata; this export took 0 for the fill, and 6.2% of the scene was fill. `Scene.from_geotiff` read
the band plainly, so 0 arrived as data — and on a scene in dB, where the sea sits near -14 dB, 0
is brighter than anything afloat. The threshold detector returned three "targets" of 72100, 38955
and 36428 pixels.

**What it would have cost.** Not a crash and not a warning. A plausible count, detections carrying
scores and coordinates like any other, and the largest of them looking in QGIS like an unusually
large vessel rather than a hole. Had it survived to the AIS fusion stage, three enormous
undeclared "vessels" would have been the headline result of the first real run.

**Why it survived until now.** Every scene the chain had ever seen was written by this repository,
and a synthetic scene has no holes. The synthetic fixture is what made the chain testable, and it
is exactly why this class of fault could only appear on the first real product: a fixture cannot
contain a defect nobody thought to put in it.

**What was done instead.** Declared nodata becomes NaN before the image reaches a detector, so a
hole cannot exceed any threshold — see docs/decisions.md for why NaN rather than a masked array.

**What it also confirmed, at no cost.** The blobs were far wider than the 64 px tile overlap and
came back duplicated across tiles, precisely as the ownership scheme's documented precondition
says they must. The scheme held; the input broke the condition it requires. That precondition had
until then been an argument on paper.

**The second thing the same run corrected.** Two numbers in the export had been assumed rather
than measured: Earth Engine returns S1 GRD bands as float64 rather than float32, so the size guard
was estimating every request at half its true size — waving through exactly what it exists to
stop — and the 32 MB cap quoted for a direct download was contradicted by a 33 MB response that
arrived without complaint. Both now come from the measurement rather than from memory.
